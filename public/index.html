		Hello.

		<h2>
			Stuff

		<p>
		So, I need a place to write. No one will see this, but that probably doesn't matter.

		Life is hard right now. I mean - not hard on a, 'I might not eat' kind of way. But hard on a, 'I might not get out of bed today' kind of way.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm out of energy and my problems just keep getting worse and worse.
