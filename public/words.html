		So, I need a place to write. No one will see this, but that probably doesn't matter.

		Life is hard right now. I mean - not hard on a, 'I might not eat' kind of way. But hard on a, 'I might not get out of bed today' kind of way.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm out of energy and my problems just keep getting worse and worse.

		Oh god I'm sad. I don't even have a good reason. Things with my gf aren't going great - she is acting all sorts of weird, and I have idea why. I don't understand why it is hard for her. It seems like she just can't get close to me. I can't tell if she is being honest all of the time or not. I feel like some things have happened which point to her not always telling me the truth - but I have no real evidence. And I don't have a good reason to not trust her. I guess that makes me an asshole. I feel like such a looser. Thirty seven years old, no savings, apartment is a piece of shit, divorced, probably in a rebound relationship, over weight. Fuck. If it weren't for my boys, I would have no reason to live. Life sucks right now - and not just for me - but for the whole god damned world. I don't even want to go into all the horrible things happening around the world right now. It makes me sick. And makes me feel even worse for complaining about the shit in my own life - which is so stupid in comparison. My therapist says that they are my problems, so they are important, because they are happening to me. But I say they have no significance to anyone else - and no one will know or care if I solve them. They have no impact on any one else at all. What is the fucking point.
