# AnthonyPetty.com

This is the source code for anthonypetty.com
as well as my resume.

This is a fun, pointless project just to build a resume and website with a single codebase,
while keeping some of the code formatted in such a way that it can serve as a resume.

This should not be considered an example of the 'right' way to write production code. :-)

You need to have 'surge' installed in order to publish:
```
sudo npm install --global surge
```
